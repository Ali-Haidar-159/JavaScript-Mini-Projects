# JavaScript Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini JavaScript projects that I have developed while learning JavaScript. These projects cover various concepts and techniques including DOM manipulation, API calls, asynchronous programming, and working with user input. 

## Introduction

Over the past few weeks, I've been learning JavaScript and have created several small projects to apply my knowledge in practical scenarios. This repository includes those projects, which cover a wide range of topics from basic DOM manipulation to integrating AI-powered chatbots.

### Projects Covered:
- Currency Converter
- University Grade Calculator
- To-Do List Application
- Weather Check App
- AI Chatbot
- Password Generator

These projects are designed to help reinforce the concepts of JavaScript and make learning more hands-on.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML
- CSS (for styling)
- Bootstrap
- APIs (for weather check and currency conversion)
- AI integration (for the chatbot)

## Mini Projects

Hereâ€™s a list of the mini-projects included in this repository:

### 1. **Currency Converter**
A simple currency converter that fetches real-time exchange rates from a public API to convert between different currencies.

### 2. **University Grade Calculator**
A tool that helps students calculate their final grades based on their scores in different subjects. It includes functionality to display the final grade, GPA, and determine the corresponding letter grade.

### 3. **To-Do List**
A to-do list application where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are saved using `localStorage`, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

### 4. **Weather Check**
An app that allows users to enter a city name and fetches current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the temperature, weather description, and more.

### 5. **AI Chatbot**
A chatbot application that uses AI to interact with users. It responds to user input with predefined responses and can provide information based on input using simple algorithms.

### 6. **Password Generator**
A tool that generates strong, random passwords based on the user's chosen criteria, such as length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

> More projects will be added as I continue learning JavaScript and build new applications!
